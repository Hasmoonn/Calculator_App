## 💡 How It Works

- User clicks buttons to input numbers/operators.
- The input is shown in the display (`<input type="text" name="display">`).
- Pressing `=` uses JavaScript's `eval()` function to calculate the result.

## ⚠️ Warning

This calculator uses the `eval()` function to evaluate expressions, which can be unsafe in production environments.
